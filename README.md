# PyCrypt
Little project to mimic Veracrypt using python.

# FileSystem:
- A really easy implementation of ext file system
- No directory system for now

there are some made option: read / create / dump / delete files + reset the disk & benchmark

I know its slow and not finished, I'm publishing this project in the hope of some people explaining why and how to make this project better.
